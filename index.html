            Sectioning
        </h1>
        <p>
            While headings do a grand, perfectly valid, job in defining the start of a new section or sub-section in a document,
            there are a number of elements that can be exploited to establish a cleaner,
            clearer semantic structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whereas div elements can be used to contain sections, used primarily as scaffolding on which to hang CSS, they don't hold a great deal of meaning.
             Sectioning involves a handful of tags that can be used to define specific parts of a page, such as articles, headers, footers, and navigation.
        </p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <article>
            <section id="Articles and Sections">
                <h2>
                    Articles and Sections
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An article element can be used to mark up a standalone section of content. This could be used just once,
                    if you think of a blog post as an article, for example, or a number of times,
                    if you imagine replicating a traditional newspaper page with numerous articles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A section element represents a more general section and could be used to split up an article, or to represent chapters, for example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    While divs could be used to make these separations (or even if you didn't need these separations for styling),
                    this provides a much richer, more meaningful document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HTML5 specifications suggest that you can use h1 elements at the start of each section,
                    which would become a sub-heading of anything preceding that section 
                    (so, in the example above, if you had an h1 immediately following the opening article tag, an h1 immediately after an opening section tag would be a sub-heading of that initial h1).
                    This screws backwards compatibility, however, and any user agents (including screen readers) that don't understand this won't apply properly structured heading levels.
                    We suggest sticking to the headings levels you would use if you didn't use sections (so h1, followed by h2, etc, regardless of the sectioning).
                    This doesn't break anything or detract from the meaning or semantics.
                </p>
